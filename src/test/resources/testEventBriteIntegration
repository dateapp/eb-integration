You'll see creativity in their music and in your training, but you'll also see the science of becoming a better runner come to life.\nREVITALAB is a home for recovery that includes in its walls a few incredible ways to sweat, chill and relax. You'll find its signature cryotherapy chamber and localized cryotherapy; NormaTec recovery technology; and infrared sauna. You'll also sneak a peak at Fresh Coast Salt - an experience that feels like spending a weekend at the beach; and you'll get an overview of the offerings from the in-house physical therapist Movement Physical Therapy.\nHere's what you can expect from the workout:\nWe'll start Sunday, November 18 with a workout that RUNAWAY will lead to showcase the classes you'll find when the studio opens its doors in Streeterville. We'll do the workout the RUNAWAY team is terming an HERE + THERE. You'll get in a fun run that will not only showcase picturesque places to run in Chicago, but also RUNAWAY's proprietary training method, AMP (Adaptive Musculoskeletal Periodization), created to help you reach running goals while still being able to mix and match your classes.\n(You can sign up for the workout here) \nWhat you can expect from the after:\nOur friends at REVITALAB will showcase a taste of the recovery they have in their walls including Cryotherapy, Fresh Coast Salt therapy, NormaTec boots, Infrared sauna and more.
